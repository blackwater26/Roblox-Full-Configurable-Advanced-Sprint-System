## Bug Description
Provide a clear and concise description of the issue.
Explain **what is wrong**, not what you expected to happen.

## Steps to Reproduce
Steps to reliably reproduce the behavior:
1. Describe the initial setup (game state, character state, config values, etc.)
2. Action taken (e.g. pressing sprint key, respawning, toggling stamina)
3. What happens next
4. Observed incorrect behavior

## Expected Behavior
Describe what **should** happen according to the system design or documentation.

## Context & Architecture Impact
(Optional but recommended)
- Does this affect **client-side input**, **server authority**, or **state synchronization**?
- Does it occur during **respawn**, **state transitions**, or **configuration changes**?

## Environment
Please complete the following information:
- Roblox Studio version:
- Knit version:
- Is the default `ConfigModule` modified? (Yes / No)
- Is this happening in Studio, Live game, or both?

## Additional Information
Add any relevant logs, screenshots, or short code snippets.
If possible, mention which module or layer you suspect (Input / State / Server / Config).
